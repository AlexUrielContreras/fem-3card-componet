## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass


### What I learned
  
  I used this challenge to learn Sass and for some more Flexbox practice.<br>
  Sass made writing CSS faster and quicker. I really enjoyed using mixins so I can apply many styles to different element while folloing DRY

### Useful resources

- [Learn Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - Sass Document
